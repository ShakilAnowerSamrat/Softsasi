# Creative Software Company Website

This is the source code for the Creative Software Company website, organized into logical sections.

## Directory Structure

The website is organized into the following directories:

*   **/** (Root): Contains the main landing page (`index.html`) and error page (`404.html`).
*   **company/**: Contains company-related pages (`about.html`, `contact.html`, `carrer.html`, `partnership.html`).
*   **services/**: Contains all service offerings and details (`service.html`, `development.html`, `consulting.html`, etc.).
*   **work/**: Contains portfolio and project pages (`work.html`, `project_detail.html`).
*   **insights/**: Contains blog and insight articles (`blog.html`, `insight.html`, etc.).
*   **assets/**: Stores all static assets (CSS, JavaScript, Images, Fonts).
*   **Softsasi-main website/**: *ignored/untouched external directory*.

## How to Run Locally

1.  Navigate to the project root directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3.  Navigate through the menu links (About, Services, Work, etc.). All links are relative and should work without a server.

## Development Notes

*   **Relative Paths**: All internal links and asset references use relative paths (e.g., `../assets/img/logo.png` inside `company/about.html`) to ensure the site works correctly in any folder depth.
*   **Assets**: The `assets/` folder contains all recovered images, fonts, and libraries needed for the site to function offline.

## Recent Updates

*   **Structure**: Grouped flat HTML files into organized subdirectories.
*   **Content**: Refreshed all pages and assets from the live site (as of latest update).
*   **Fixes**: Repaired broken links and ensured all missing assets were downloaded.
